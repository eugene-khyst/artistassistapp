## <a id="1"></a>Overview

**ArtistAssistApp** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for artists to accurately mix any color from a
photo, analyze tonal values, turn a photo into an outline, draw with the grid method, paint with a
limited palette, simplify a photo, and more.

## <a id="4"></a>Implementation details

ArtistAssistApp does not use artificial intelligence (AI), but rather mathematics.

The web app doesn't depend on any math or color library and includes the implementation of the
following:

- conversion between color models (e.g. sRGB to OKLCH),
- sRGB to spectral reflectance curve,
- subtractive color mixing using weighted geometric mean of reflectance curves,
- matrix operations,
- matrix inversion using LU decomposition,
- solving a system of linear algebraic equations using forward and backward substitution,
- the average color of the circular area of the image
- color distance (deltaEOK),
- vector operations,
- median blur filter using sliding window and histogram,
- erosion morphological filter,
- median cut for color quantization,
- RGB to grayscale conversion based on perceived lightness,
- ranking images using pairwise comparison and Elo rating system,
- and more.

The web app uses Web Workers for parallel processing and Service Workers for offline access.
